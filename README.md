 This report analyzes different types of wines using various statistical learning methods.
 The main goal is to classify wines as red and white based on their chemical properties and
 to explore the dataâ€™s underlying structure. For supervised learning, we applied models like
 logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost
 to predict the wine types. In unsupervised learning, we used techniques such as Principal
 Component Analysis (PCA), UMAP, and t-SNE to visualize the data and discover patterns
 without predefined labels. Clustering algorithms like K-Means and hierarchical clustering were
 used on the reduced datasets to group similar wines together. The study concludes by discussing
 the findings and highlighting key insights from both supervised and unsupervised methods.
